# Build Notes

## Main Assembly (asm)
- chassis_top/bottom.gcode 
    - Nema17 mounting holes 
        - M3 hole in part too tight. Was 3.05mm dia.
        - M3x6 screw good length
    - Motor allignment circle too large
    - SK8 mount
        - M5x16 works well. Need more

## LED Carrier Assembly (asm)
    - M3 Lead screw nut mounting holes too small. Moved from 3.1mm to 3.3
        - This should moved to a tapped hole in production

## Parts
    - SK8 will not immobilize the rail when tigntened down
